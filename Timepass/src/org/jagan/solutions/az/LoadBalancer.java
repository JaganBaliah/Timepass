	/*
	 * 
	 * Your server has received a package of N incoming requests. 
	 * Handling the K-th request (for K from 0 to N âˆ’ 1) will take A[K] seconds.
	 * 
	 * The load balancer has to drop two acquired requests and distribute the rest
	 * of them between three workers in such a way that each worker receives a
	 * contiguous fragment of requests to handle, and finishes handling them in
	 * exactly the same moment as the other workers. No two workers should receive
	 * the same request to compute.
	 * 
	 * The load balancer's distribution of requests is performed by selecting two
	 * requests that will be dropped, and which will split the array into three
	 * contiguous parts that will be allocated to the workers. More precisely, if
	 * requests 2 and 5 are chosen by the load balancer from a package of 9
	 * requests, then:
	 * 
	 * the 0-th to 1-st requests will be handled by the first worker, the 3-rd to
	 * 4-th requests will be handled by the second worker, the 6-th to 8-th requests
	 * will be handled by the third worker. Such a distribution will be correct if
	 * each worker receives requests equalling the same total amount of handling
	 * time.
	 * 
	 * Write a function solution that, given an array A of N integers representing
	 * the time of execution of consecutive tasks, returns true if it is possible
	 * for the load balancer to choose two requests that will determine an even
	 * distribution of requests among three workers, or false otherwise.
	 * 
	 * Examples:
	 * 
	 * Given A = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2], the function should return true, as
	 * choosing requests 2 and 5 results in a distribution giving 4 seconds of
	 * handling time to each worker, as explained in the following image: image
	 * 
	 * Given A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return false.
	 * 
	 * Given A = [1, 2, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2] of length 20,000, the function should
	 * return true.
	 * 
	 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
	 * 
	 * N is an integer within the range [5..100,000]; each element of array A is an
	 * integer within the range [1..10,000].
